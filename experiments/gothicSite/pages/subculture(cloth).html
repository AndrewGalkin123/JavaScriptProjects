                    The gothic subculture emphasizes individualism, melancholy, and sensuality.
                    It may also include
                    an interest in occult and mystical themes.
                    Goths often express their feelings
                    and thoughts through art, music,
                    and poetry that reflect their
                    inner world and experiences.
                    The gothic subculture
                    draws inspiration from literary works such as the writings of Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker's
                    "Dracula," Oscar Wilde, and other authors whose works often reflect the dark and mystical aspects of
                    human nature.</div>

                    Gothic fashion is an eccentric style distinguished by its preference for dark shades, primarily
                    black, and dramatic elements. It often includes long dresses, leather garments, mesh fabrics, and
                    numerous metallic accessories. Gothic fashion emphasizes individuality, art, and mystique. It
                    incorporates distinctive features such as accentuating the eyes with black cosmetics, often dyeing
                    hair in dark shades, and accessories that may include symbols of mysticism and romance. This fashion
                    style aims to express the dark and mystical aspects of human nature and inspire creative

                    Tolerance and communication are essential principles within the gothic subculture. Goths typically
