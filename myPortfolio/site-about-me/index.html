                <p class="job-title">Frontend developer</p><br><br><br>
                <p class="info-about-me">At the age of 12, I stumbled into the world of information technology through
                    online courses at STEP Academy.
                    Despite a brief hiatus, my passion for IT remained unwavering. A year later, I enrolled in Java
                    courses at Hillel,
                    diving headfirst into object-oriented programming. However, the vast realm of programming beckoned,
                    leading me to explore JavaScript,
                    which became my gateway to frontend development.
                    With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in my toolkit, I now create compelling web experiences.</p>

                                <p>I have developed two Telegram bots, each serving a specific purpose.
                                    The first bot is dedicated to helping users with mathematics.
                                    It's equipped with various math-related features, including solving equations,

                                    Users can interact with this bot to get instant assistance with their math-related
                                    queries,

                                    receiving food through Telegram.
                                    Users can browse menus, place orders, specify delivery preferences, and make
